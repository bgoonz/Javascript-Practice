# JavasScript

### JavaScipt is a dynamic weakly typed language which is compiled at runtime.

**How is JS Executed?** _using a js engine like v8 or spidermonkey which parses the code and then compiles to machine code and then exicutes machine code_

**Dynamic Typing** _(not pre-compiled) means that you don't tell the engine what type of data a variable holds, it figures it out while your code is running_

**Weakly Typed** _means that different types can be converted to other types automatically_
